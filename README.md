## Overview

I just finished a course on CSS, and now I'm in the stage where I need to get more experience actually building things to improve.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned I really need to keep at learning CSS. I didn't finish the problem as quickly as I would have liked.
I was unsure about some things that I'm positive are really simple. But, that's what practice is for.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning more about Flexbox & Grid. I also would like to learn the best practices for structuring CSS.
Once I'm comfortable, I'll move on to backend development, getting better at React, and learning some DevOps.
